# COMPSCI-335-Assignment-1-Web-Application-Development

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>La Boutique Cass√©e is an online shop selling books and blurays. The shop uses a service-oriented architecture with a customer-facing UI front-end, and a service back-end. The service back-end consists of two separate services and associated RESTful interfaces.
One of the services is open to all, and allows the user to browse and search through the shop. It also allows a user to place and view comments on the shop, as well as to register at the shop. The other service is only for registered users and this allows purchasing of items. Registered users are required to authenticate before using this service.
We were asked to develop the customer-facing UI front-end using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>The requirements were to have three logical sections in the UI: 
<ol>
<li>Viewing the items being sold (books and blurays)</li>
<li>Viewing and leaving comments</li>
<li>User registration. One may also consider having a fourth logical section that might have an "About" description.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This web application was developed to also comply with the following requirements:
<br>
<ol>
<li>You are not allowed to use any libraries or frameworks.</li>
<li>The application should contain a single HTML page</li>
<li>The application should work on any modern browser (such as Chrome, Safari and Edge).</li>
<li>The application should work on small screen devices. You can test this by making your browser window narrow.</li>
</ol>
